Backlog
=======

A sandbox project, to experiment Symfony2
-----------------------------------------

It's always useful to have some sort of playground, where you can test and
crash things, on some of real conditions.

Other playgrounds exist:

* https://github.com/juliendidier/JulBox
* https://github.com/hhamon/Hangman
* Fork me, add yours

This project is all about this.

What's inside?
--------------

* Behat features ([``app/features``][0] and [``behat.yml``][1])
* Doctrine joined inheritance ([``BacklogRow``][2])
